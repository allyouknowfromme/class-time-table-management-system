Time table management system is a project which is developed to provide better support for lecturers and students in a college. Time Table Management System provides a function to view timetable for the specific lecturer and the master timetable for that semester. Lecturer can inquire about classes availability and can book for the free classes. Students can view their functionality like adding and dropping subjects. Students can view and get the registration slip from the system. Timetable management system also contains a database, which stores the lecturers and students personal details.
